/*Shared Memory Setup:
Create shared memory segments to store intersection states (e.g., pthread_mutex_t for
mutexes, sem_t for semaphores).

After parsing the input text files, the parent configures shared memory segments to manage intersection
resources. These segments store mutexes (implemented as pthread_mutex_t structures) for intersections
with a capacity of 1, ensuring exclusive access for single-track sections like narrow bridges. For multi-track
intersections (capacity > 1), the parent initializes counting semaphores (sem_t), setting their values to
match the specified capacitiesâ€”for example, a semaphore initialized to 3 for an intersection that can
accommodate three trains simultaneously. 

Additionally, the shared memory includes a resource
allocation table, which tracks active locks (e.g., IntersectionB: [Train2, Train5]), and synchronization
metadata detailing intersection types (mutex/semaphore), capacities, and real-time lock states. This setup
enables the server to enforce access rules and monitor resource usage efficiently. */

/* The Resource Allocation Table should look something like this

	ID		Type		Capacity		Lock State		Holding Trains

	A       Mutex 		1				Locked			[Train 1]
	B		Semaphore 	2				Locked			[Train1, Train2]
	C 		Mutex 		1				Locked 			[Train 3]
	D		Semaphore 	3				Locked 			[Train 2, Train 3]
	E 		Mutex 		1 				Locked 			[Train 4]
